## Installation

### Manual Installation

To install the plugin manually, download the zip-version of this repository and unzip it under `/your/site/grav/user/plugins`. Then rename the folder to `markdown-folding`. You can find these files on [GitHub](https://github.com/alexey-rasskazov/grav-plugin-markdown-folding) or via [GetGrav.org](http://getgrav.org/downloads/plugins#extras).

You should now have all the plugin files under

    /your/site/grav/user/plugins/markdown-folding
	
## Configuration

Before configuring this plugin, you should copy the `user/plugins/markdown-folding/markdown-folding.yaml` to `user/config/plugins/markdown-folding.yaml` and only edit that copy.

Here is the default configuration and an explanation of available options:

```yaml
enabled: true
```

Note that if you use the Admin Plugin, a file with your configuration named markdown-folding.yaml will be saved in the `user/config/plugins/`-folder once the configuration is saved in the Admin.
